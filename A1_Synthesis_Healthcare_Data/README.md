# A1 - Building a Model for the Synthesis of Tabular Healthcare Data

In this activity, you will propose and generate a synthetic database of blood count test results. 
It does not need to be a deep learning-based approach; it can be a rule-based approach or based on classical statistical models.
Attached are three spreadsheets extracted from a database of clinical laboratory test results. These are real data obtained from a blood center in São Paulo. Since it is real data, you will face typical problems such as a lack of a proper data dictionary and the need for data cleaning. Identification fields have been transformed to ensure complete patient anonymization. 
Propose a method, implement, and present a synthetic database with at least 1,000 fictitious test results. Allowed simplification: synthesize only one of the blood count parameters. Other simplifications must be duly justified. 
A Google Colab notebook must be submitted, detailing and explaining your implementation. Answer the following question: How do you ensure your data synthesis is realistic? Explain the criteria used.
